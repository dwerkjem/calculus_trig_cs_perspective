\begin{abstract}
    In this paper, I explore the process of learning trigonometry and calculus from the perspective of a computer scientist. I begin with an overview of my background in computer science, highlighting how it has shaped my approach to mathematical concepts. Following this, I delve into my experiences with mathematical learning, discussing the challenges and the insights gained. Additionally, I present key questions I had before and after learning these mathematical fields, and reflect on their practical applications within computer science.
